Development Guidelines
Component Creation
Components should be created using the function declaration syntax instead of arrow functions or React.FC:
typescriptCopyfunction Button({ variant = "base", children, disabled = false, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
return (
// Component JSX
);
}
State Management
The application uses React's built-in state management solutions:

useState for component-level state
useContext for theme management
localStorage for data persistence

Styling
The project uses a combination of styled-components and Material-UI:

Styled Components for custom component styling
Material-UI for form elements and basic UI components
Global styles defined in GlobalStyle.ts
Theme configurations in the themes directory

Type Safety
TypeScript interfaces are defined for all major data structures:

INote for Post-It note data
ITheme for theme configuration
Component prop interfaces for type safety
